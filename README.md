Scraping and visualizing prerequisites for UofT courses. Fun little data project I'm using to get comfortable with BeautifulSoup, Streamlit, etc. 

I wrote a scraping script using BeautifulSoup to extract course information into courses.json. The webpages are stored locally for now but that will be changed.
Run app.py for a streamlit visualizer.
