Scraping and visualizing prerequisites for UofT courses. Fun little project I'm using to get comfortable with web scraping using BeautifulSoup and general web development. Good tree practice as well.

I wrote a scraping script using BeautifulSoup to extract course information into courses.json.

Try a demo here: [https://jeodn.github.io/website-me/projects/prereq.html](https://jeodn.github.io/website-me/projects/prereq.html). This version runs directly on the browser, so the app script and data is loaded locally. As a result, this version only has math courses from UofT Missisauga.
